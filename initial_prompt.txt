Initial prompt
Act as a Senior Game Developer and an expert in HTML5 and JavaScript. I want you to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a 2D cinematic platformer game inspired by the mechanics of the original 1989 Prince of Persia.

The Story & Character:

The protagonist is a young adventurer named Hugo.

The setting should feel like a dungeon or castle.

Technical Stack:

Use raw HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

Keep everything in a single index.html file so I can run it immediately by opening it in a browser.

Do not require external assets (images) yet; use colored rectangles to represent the character, tiles, and enemies for now (Placeholder graphics).

Core Gameplay Mechanics (MVP Requirements):

Movement: The character must have "weighty" movement (acceleration/deceleration), not instant arcade movement.

Ledge Climbing: This is the most important Prince of Persia feature. If Hugo jumps and hits the edge of a platform, he should grab the ledge and pull himself up.

Hazards: Include static spikes on the floor that reset the level if touched.

Level Design: Create one short level with a starting point, a few gaps to jump, a ledge to climb, and a "Door" at the end that triggers a "Level Complete" message.

Visual Style:

Background: Dark grey/stone color.

Hugo: A distinct color (e.g., Bright Blue or Red) so he stands out.

Platforms: Bricks/stone texture (or solid color).

Please write the complete, functional code for this MVP.
